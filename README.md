### 🚧 Currently Learning

While I have a strong grip on foundational tools like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**, I’m currently expanding my expertise in several other technologies to become a more well-rounded data analyst.

I'm actively working on deepening my understanding of **Seaborn** for more advanced and aesthetically pleasing data visualizations. I’ve started exploring **MySQL** and **Oracle** to strengthen my knowledge of relational databases, query optimization, and data integration across platforms.

Additionally, I’m putting effort into enhancing my use of **Jupyter Notebook**—focusing on writing cleaner, more documented code with a strong emphasis on storytelling through data. I’ve also been investing time in mastering **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques to uncover hidden trends, detect anomalies, and provide more impactful insights before diving into modeling.

Although I’m already familiar with tools like **Microsoft PowerPoint** and **C++**, I aim to incorporate them more efficiently into my workflow—whether it's presenting analysis or improving problem-solving logic through programming fundamentals.

I believe consistent practice and real-world application of these tools will gradually elevate my skill set, enabling me to take on more complex analytical challenges and deliver higher value through data.
